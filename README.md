### 🔍 Project Overview
This is a **Machine Learning** powered web application that predicts whether a breast tumor is **Malignant** (cancerous) or **Benign** (non-cancerous) based on cell nucleus characteristics. 

Built with **Python**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Streamlit**, this tool aims to provide a fast and accessible way to visualize diagnostic data and get instant model predictions.

### 📊 Dataset Details
I used the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Kaggle).
- **Instances:** 569
- **Features:** 30 (Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, etc.)
- **Model:** Logistic Regression
- **Performance:** Achieved high accuracy in classifying diagnostic results.

### 🚀 Key Features
- **Interactive UI:** Simple sliders or input fields for data entry.
- **Instant Prediction:** Get diagnostic results in real-time.
- **Clean Dashboard:** Powered by Streamlit for a professional look and feel.
- **Educational:** Useful for students and researchers to understand ML classification.
